    <h1>Hadlee Nix</h1>

    <p>An actress, waiting to be found.</p>

    <p>Also, I am trying to learn web development. It's going slowly, as you can see.</p>

    <h2>Why am I would be the perfect person to cast as Poison Ivy?</h2>

    <p>Top 10 reasons:
        <ol>
            <li>She is a bisexual eco-terrorist with super powers. So, we have <b>some</b> things in common.</li>
            <li>I have a PhD (not in plant science, unfortunately), which means I work hard, I'm clearly old/experienced enough to play her, and I have been driven to madness by academia too.</li>
            <li>My hair loves henna, I was born to be ginger without actually being born ginger.</li>
            <li>My favourite colour is dark green.</li>
            <li>I have never been in a Marvel film. Or any film. So you will have something no one else will have.</li>
            <li>I can act, but her hatred of humanity and love of plants is easy to relate to for me.</li>
            <li>As a relatively unknown person, it may be harder to "cancel" me.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I have an annoying personality so more people will see the film to critisize my performance, which means more money for the film!</li>
            <li>Who else would start learning web dev from scratch for a role?</li>
            <li>My website is linked to a <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/">carbon emissions calculator</a>.</li>
        </ol>
